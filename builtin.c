/**
 * cell_env - Display all environment variables
 * @args: Command arguments (unused in this function)
 * 
 * This function prints all the environment variables available in the current
 * shell session. Environment variables are key-value pairs that provide
 * information about the system environment and user settings.
 * 
 * How it works:
 * - The function accesses the global variable `environ`, which is declared
 *   with the `extern` keyword. This indicates that `environ` is defined
 *   elsewhere, typically by the system's C library, and is available for use
 *   in this file.
 * - The `extern` keyword is used to declare a variable without defining it,
 *   allowing the variable to be shared across multiple files. In this case,
 *   `environ` is a pointer to an array of strings, where each string is an
 *   environment variable formatted as "KEY=VALUE".
 * - The function iterates over this array and prints each environment variable
 *   to the standard output, followed by a newline.
 * - If the `environ` array is NULL, indicating that no environment variables
 *   are available, the function returns 1 to signal failure.
 * - Otherwise, it returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
 * 
 * Note: The `args` parameter is not used in this function, but it is included
 * to maintain a consistent function signature for built-in shell commands.
 * 
 * Return: 0 on success, 1 on failure (if no environment variables are found).
